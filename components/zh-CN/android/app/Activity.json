    "description": "An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do. Almost all activities interact with the user, so the Activity class takes care of creating a window for you in which you can place your UI with #setContentView. While activities are often presented to the user as full-screen windows, they can also be used in other ways: as floating windows (via a theme with android.R.attr#windowIsFloating set).",
