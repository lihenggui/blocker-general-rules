    "description": "Captures @code android.intent.action.ACTION_PACKAGE_FULLY_REMOVED intents and triggers the removal of associated android.telecom.PhoneAccounts via the com.android.telecom.PhoneAccountRegistrar. Note: This class listens for the @code PACKAGE_FULLY_REMOVED intent rather than @code PACKAGE_REMOVED as @code PACKAGE_REMOVED is triggered on re-installation of the same package, where @code PACKAGE_FULLY_REMOVED is triggered only when an application is completely uninstalled. This is desirable as we do not wish to un-register all android.telecom.PhoneAccounts associated with a package being re-installed to ensure the enabled state of the accounts is retained. When default call screening application is removed, set Settings.Secure.CALL_SCREENING_DEFAULT_APPLICATION as null into provider.",
