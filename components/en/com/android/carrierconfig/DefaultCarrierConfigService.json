    "description": "Provides network overrides for carrier configuration. The configuration available through CarrierConfigManager is a combination of default values, default network overrides, and carrier overrides. The default network overrides are provided by this service. For a given network, we look for a matching XML file in our assets folder, and return the PersistableBundle from that file. Assets are preferred over Resources because resource overlays only support using MCC+MNC and that doesn't work with MVNOs. The only resource file used is vendor.xml, to provide vendor-specific overrides.",
