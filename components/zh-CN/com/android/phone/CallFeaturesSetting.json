    "description": "Top level \"Call settings\" UI; see res/xml/call_feature_setting.xml This preference screen is the root of the \"Call settings\" hierarchy available from the Phone app; the settings here let you control various features related to phone calls (including voicemail settings, the \"Respond via SMS\" feature, and others.) It's used only on voice-capable phone devices. Note that this activity is part of the package com.android.phone, even though you reach it from the \"Phone\" app (i.e. DialtactsActivity) which is from the package com.android.contacts. For the \"Mobile network settings\" screen under the main Settings app, See com.android.settings.network.telephony.MobileNetworkActivity.",
