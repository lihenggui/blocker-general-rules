    "description": "Service that hosts download jobs. Each active download job is handled as a unique DownloadThread instance. The majority of downloads should have ETag values to enable resuming, so if a given download isn't able to finish in the normal job timeout (10 minutes), we just reschedule the job and resume again in the future.",
