There are 4 tables in EAB DB: <ul> <li><em>Contact:</em> It stores the name and phone number of the contact. <li><em>Common:</em> It's a general table for storing the query results and the mechanisms of querying UCE capabilities. It should be 1:1 mapped to the contact table and has a foreign key(eab_contact_id) that refers to the id of contact table. If the value of mechanism is 1 ( android.telephony.ims.RcsContactUceCapability#CAPABILITY_MECHANISM_PRESENCE), the capability information should be stored in presence table, if the value of mechanism is 2( android.telephony.ims.RcsContactUceCapability#CAPABILITY_MECHANISM_OPTIONS), it should be stored in options table. <li><em>Presence:</em> It stores the information ( android.telephony.ims.RcsContactUceCapability) that queried through presence server. It should be *:1 mapped to the common table and has a foreign key(eab_common_id) that refers to the id of common table. <li><em>Options:</em> It stores the information ( android.telephony.ims.RcsContactUceCapability) that queried through SIP OPTIONS. It should be *:1 mapped to the common table and it has a foreign key(eab_common_id) that refers to the id of common table. </ul>",
