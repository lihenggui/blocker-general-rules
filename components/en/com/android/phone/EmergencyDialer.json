    "description": "EmergencyDialer is a special dialer that is used ONLY for dialing emergency calls. It's a simplified version of the regular dialer (i.e. the TwelveKeyDialer activity from apps/Contacts) that: 1. Allows ONLY emergency calls to be dialed 2. Disallows voicemail functionality 3. Allows this activity to stay in front of the keyguard. TODO: Even though this is an ultra-simplified version of the normal dialer, there's still lots of code duplication between this class and the TwelveKeyDialer class from apps/Contacts. Could the common code be moved into a shared base class that would live in the framework? Or could we figure out some way to move *thisclass into apps/Contacts also?",
