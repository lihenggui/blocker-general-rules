    "description": "This class is a content provider that publishes the system settings. It can be accessed via the content provider APIs or via custom call commands. The latter is a bit faster and is the preferred way to access the platform settings. There are three settings types, global (with signature level protection and shared across users), secure (with signature permission level protection and per user), and system (with dangerous permission level protection and per user). Global settings are stored under the device owner. Each of these settings is represented by a com.android.providers.settings.SettingsState object mapped to an integer key derived from the setting type in the most significant bits and user id in the least significant bits. Settings are synchronously loaded on instantiation of a SettingsState and asynchronously persisted on mutation. Settings are stored in the user specific system directory. Apps targeting APIs Lollipop MR1 and lower can add custom settings entries and get a warning. Targeting higher API version prohibits this as the system settings are not a place for apps to save their state. When a package is removed the settings it added are deleted. Apps cannot delete system settings added by the platform. System settings values are validated to ensure the clients do not put bad values. Global and secure settings are changed only by trusted parties, therefore no validation is performed. Also there is a limit on the amount of app specific settings that can be added to prevent unlimited growth of the system process memory footprint.",
