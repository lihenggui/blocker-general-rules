    "description": "A trampoline activity that is responsible for: Performing precondition checks before starting the actual screenshot activity. Communicating with the screenshot activity and the calling activity. As this activity is started in a bubble app, the windowing for this activity is restricted to the parent bubble app. The screenshot editing activity, see AppClipsActivity, is started in a regular activity window using Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK. However, Activity#startActivityForResult(Intent, int) is not compatible with Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK. So, this activity acts as a trampoline activity to abstract the complexity of communication with the screenshot editing activity for a simpler developer experience.
